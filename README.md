# eco_drive

The proposed Flutter application is designed to display a categorized list of vehicles based on their fuel efficiency and pollution levels. The app evaluates vehicles based on two key parameters: mileage (km/litre) and age (years).

Green-coded: Vehicles with 15 km/l or more mileage and â‰¤5 years old (fuel-efficient & low pollutant).
Amber-coded: Vehicles with 15 km/l or more mileage but >5 years old (fuel-efficient but moderately pollutant).
Red-coded: All other vehicles (low fuel efficiency & high pollutant).
